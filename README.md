# CoinGecko Engineering Written Assignment - Url Shortener

This is a URL Shortener web application built with Next.js, TailwindCSS and MongoDB that allows users to convert user-provided target URL ("_Target URL_") to short-form URL ("_Short URL_"), track number of clicks, originating geolocation and timestamp of each visit to a Short URL & can be publicly shared and accessed.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies were used to build the URL shortener:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling web applications.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL document-oriented database for storing and retrieving data.

## Prerequisites

Before moving into installing this project, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js `v16.13.2+` and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git & GitKraken
- [MongoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud)

## Branching Strategy

The URL shortener project uses the Gitflow branching strategy, which is a well-known and widely used model for managing Git branches. The Gitflow model defines two main branches: `master` and `develop`, as well as several **supporting branches** for **feature development**, **hotfixes**, and **releases**.

`master`: The `master` branch contains the stable and production-ready code. It should only be updated through merges from the `release` or `hotfix` branches.

`develop`: The `develop` branch contains the latest development code, which may not be fully tested or stable. All new features, bug fixes, and other changes should be merged into develop before they can be merged into master.

`feature/xxx`: A `feature` branch is used to develop a new features or functionality. They should be created from `develop` and merged back into `develop` once they are completed and tested.

`hotfix/xxx`: Hotfix branches are used to fix critical bugs or issues in the production code. They should be created from master and merged into both `master` and `develop` once the fixes are completed and tested.

`release/xxx`: Release branches are used to prepare a new release of the codebase. They should be created from `develop` and merged into both `develop`and `master` once they are ready for deployment.

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EugeneGohh/url-shortener
   ```

2. Navigate into the respository by using

   ```
   cd url-shortener
   ```

3. Install all the required dependencies by running

   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file which located at the root of the directory to `.env` (which will be ignored by Git)

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. For setting up MongoDB in the cloud, please refer to this [guide](./MongoDB%20Setup%20Guide.md).
6. Add your MongoDB connection string

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=https://url-trimming.vercel.app/
   BASE=http://localhost:3000
   ```

7. Start the development server by running

   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## Configuration

The URL shortener project should be configured using these environment variables, which are defined in the `.env` file. Here are the available environment variables:

`MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection string.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL`: The production URL of the web application, used for generating shorten URLs in **production environment**.

`BASE`: The base URL of the web app in development environment, used for generating shorten URLs in **development environment**.

## Usage

To shorten a URL, follow these steps:

1. Enter a long URL in the input field.
2. Click the "**scissor**" button located on right of the input field.
3. Click the "**Get New Data**" button to bring in new data of the shortened URL.
4. A **Short URL**, the **original Target URL** and the **Title tag of the Target URL** returned in a new card.
5. Click "**View Report**", to view **number of clicks**, **originating geolocation** and **timestamp** of each visit to the Short URL
6. Copy the shortened URL to your clipboard or share it directly on social media.

## APIs

The URL shortener contains these RESTful APIs for

1. Retrieving all shortened URLs.
2. Receiving a Target URL as input, generates a unique short URL with a maximum length of 15 characters, stores the Target URL and short URL in a database, and returns the short URL, Target URL, and title tag of the Target URL to the user.
3. Generating a usage report for the application, tracking the number of clicks, originating geolocation, and timestamp of each visit to a Short URL.
4. Receiving a short URL as input, looks up the corresponding Target URL in the database, records the number of clicks, originating geolocation, and timestamp of the visit in the database, and redirects the user to the Target URL.
5. Receiving a short URL as input, looks up the corresponding Target URL in the database, generates a social media post with the Target URL and short URL, and returns the post to the user.

**The API endpoints are**:

```
GET /api/all
Get all the shortened URLs

POST /api/shorten?origUrl="TARGET_URL"
Create a new short url based on target url

GET /api/update?urlId="URL_ID"
Update number of clicks, originating geolocation, and
timestamp of each visit to a Short URL

GET /api/redirect?shortUrl="SHORT_URL"
Update number of clicks, originating geolocation,
and timestamp of the visit in the database.
Redirects the user to the Target URL.

GET /api/share?shortUrl="SHORT_URL"
Generates a social media post with the Target URL and short URL
```
